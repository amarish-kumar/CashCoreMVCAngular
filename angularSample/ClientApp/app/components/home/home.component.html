<h1>Hello, from the Atm!</h1>
<p>Welcome to your new single-page application, built with VS2017:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href='https://get.asp.net/'>ASP.NET Core</a> and <a href='https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx'>C#</a> for cross-platform server-side code</li>
    <li><a href='https://angular.io/'>Angular 2</a> and <a href='http://www.typescriptlang.org/'>TypeScript</a> for client-side code</li>
    <li><a href='https://webpack.github.io/'>Webpack</a> for building and bundling client-side resources</li>
    <li><a href='http://getbootstrap.com/'>Bootstrap</a> for layout and styling</li>
    <li><a href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WCFCORETEAM.VisualStudioWCFConnectedService/'>WCF</a> for support of WCF and connected services</li>
    <li><a href='https://github.com/aspnet/Tooling/blob/master/known-issues-vs2015.md#missing-sdk/'>Issues with vs 2015</a> to solve possible problems</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you get started, we've also set up:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Secure ATM navigation</strong>. two algorithms one <em>for units of 20</em> and another for the <em> least amount</em> of units. This is by no means finish but the structure is there for coding more elaborate cases.</li>
    <li><strong>Client-side navigation</strong>. For example, click <em>Counter</em> then <em>Back</em> to return here.</li>
    <li><strong>Server-side prerendering</strong>. For faster initial loading and improved SEO, your Angular 2 app is prerendered on the server. The resulting HTML is then transferred to the browser where a client-side copy of the app takes over.</li>
    <li><strong>Webpack dev middleware</strong>. In development mode, there's no need to run the <code>webpack</code> build tool. Your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand. Updates are available as soon as you modify any file.</li>
    <li><strong>Hot module replacement</strong>. In development mode, you don't even need to reload the page after making most changes. Within seconds of saving changes to files, your Angular 2 app will be rebuilt and a new instance injected is into the page.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficient production builds</strong>. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and the <code>webpack</code> build tool produces minified static CSS and JavaScript files.</li>
</ul>
